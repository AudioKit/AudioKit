If your issue is implementing AudioKit in your own code, post your problem to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=AudioKit) with the #AudioKit hashtag.

If you can make the issue happen on [AudioKit 5's Cookbook app](https://github.com/AudioKit/Cookbook/) then you can create an issue directly on that repository as well.

GitHub Issues should only be used for confirmed problems with AudioKit and
well-defined feature requests.
