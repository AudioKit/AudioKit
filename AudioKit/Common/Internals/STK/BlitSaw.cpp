/*! \class BlitSaw
    \brief STK band-limited sawtooth wave class.

    This class generates a band-limited sawtooth waveform using a
    closed-form algorithm reported by Stilson and Smith in "Alias-Free
    Digital Synthesis of Classic Analog Waveforms", 1996.  The user
    can specify both the fundamental frequency of the sawtooth and the
    number of harmonics contained in the resulting signal.

    If nHarmonics is 0, then the signal will contain all harmonics up
    to half the sample rate.  Note, however, that this setting may
    produce aliasing in the signal when the frequency is changing (no
    automatic modification of the number of harmonics is performed by
    the setFrequency() function).

    Based on initial code of Robin Davies, 2005.
    Modified algorithm code by Gary Scavone, 2005.
