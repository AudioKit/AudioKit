/*! \class FileWvIn
    \brief STK audio file input class.

    This class inherits from WvIn.  It provides a "tick-level"
    interface to the FileRead class.  It also provides variable-rate
    playback functionality.  Audio file support is provided by the
    FileRead class.  Linear interpolation is used for fractional read
    rates.

    FileWvIn supports multi-channel data.  It is important to
    distinguish the tick() method that computes a single frame (and
    returns only the specified sample of a multi-channel frame) from
    the overloaded one that takes an StkFrames object for
    multi-channel and/or multi-frame data.

    FileWvIn will either load the entire content of an audio file into
    local memory or incrementally read file data from disk in chunks.
    This behavior is controlled by the optional constructor arguments
    \e chunkThreshold and \e chunkSize.  File sizes greater than \e
    chunkThreshold (in sample frames) will be read incrementally in
    chunks of \e chunkSize each (also in sample frames).

    When the file end is reached, subsequent calls to the tick()
    functions return zeros and isFinished() returns \e true.

    See the FileRead class for a description of the supported audio
    file formats.
