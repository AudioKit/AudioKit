/*! \class FileWvOut
    \brief STK audio file output class.

    This class inherits from WvOut.  It provides a "tick-level"
    interface to the FileWrite class.

    FileWvOut writes samples to an audio file and supports
    multi-channel data.  It is important to distinguish the tick()
    method that outputs a single sample to all channels in a sample
    frame from the overloaded one that takes a reference to an
    StkFrames object for multi-channel and/or multi-frame data.

    See the FileWrite class for a description of the supported audio
    file formats.

    Currently, FileWvOut is non-interpolating and the output rate is
    always Stk::sampleRate().
