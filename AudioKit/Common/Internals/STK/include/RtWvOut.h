/*! \class RtWvOut
    \brief STK realtime audio (blocking) output class.

    This class provides a simplified interface to RtAudio for realtime
    audio output.  It is a subclass of WvOut.  This class makes use of
    RtAudio's callback functionality by creating a large ring-buffer
    into which data is written.  This class should not be used when
    low-latency is desired.

    RtWvOut supports multi-channel data in interleaved format.  It is
    important to distinguish the tick() method that outputs a single
    sample to all channels in a sample frame from the overloaded one
    that takes a reference to an StkFrames object for multi-channel
    and/or multi-frame data.
