/*! \class Thread
    \brief STK thread class.

    This class provides a uniform interface for cross-platform
    threads.  On unix systems, the pthread library is used.  Under
    Windows, the C runtime threadex functions are used.

    Each instance of the Thread class can be used to control a single
    thread process.  Routines are provided to signal cancelation
    and/or joining with a thread, though it is not possible for this
    class to know the running status of a thread once it is started.

    For cross-platform compatibility, thread functions should be
    declared as follows:

    THREAD_RETURN THREAD_TYPE thread_function(void *ptr)

    by Perry R. Cook and Gary P. Scavone, 1995--2016.
