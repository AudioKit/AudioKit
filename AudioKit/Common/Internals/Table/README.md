# AudioKit Tables

Tables are just arrays of float data. They are most often used to store waveform data and they have some defaults for the most common cases:

* sine wave
* triangle wave
* square wave
* sawtooth wave
* reverse sawtooth wave
* positive sine
* positive triangle
* positive square
* positive sawtooth
* positive reverse sawtooth

Tables can also store audio or control data.

There is a [playground](http://audiokit.io/playgrounds/Basics/Tables/) available for experimenting with tables:
