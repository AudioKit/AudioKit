/**
 @brief Provides synchcronization conversion from render time to "player time".

 @discussion
 Converts AudioTimeStamp from system audioTime to a timestamp that represents
 the progression of a time in the context of a timeline.  The AudioTimeStamp
 retrieved from the audio thread is constantly incrementing. AKTimeline sets
 a base time that acts as time-zero, giving a reference point with which to
 syncronize with other sources of audio that exibit this behavior.  The timeline
 supports loop start, and loop duration.  In order to use it, instantiate it with
 function pointer to an AKTimelineCallback function. Then, within an audio render
 callback, or a render notify callback, call AKTimelineRender once per render.
 AKTimeline will call the AKTimelineCallback provided with an AudioTimeStamp that
 has a mSampleTime that falls within a zero based timeline.  All time arguments are
 sample times, representing the time within the timeline, or audioTimes, representing
 an audioTimeStamp that is in the context of the audio render thread.  All audioTime
 arguments will discard mHostTime unless mSampleTime is not valid. Changes made on
 threads other than the audio thread will not take effect until AKTimelineRender
 is called from the audio thread, with the exception of AKTimelineSetRenderState,
 which is designed to be called only from the audio render thread.
