# AudioKit MIDI

This is an implementation of CoreMIDI meant to simplify creating and responding to MIDI signals. 

It was originally an Objective-C implementation that is now mostly in Swift.

In ]2018 we are planning to renovate this and release it as a separate module that AudioKit will have as an optional dependency.
