# Analysis Nodes

AudioKit contains two nodes that can be put into your signal chain to provide you with frequency and amplitude information
about the signal. 

The frequency tracker is monophonic, which means it can't detect multiple notes in a chord for instance. A polyphnic
frequency tracker would be a much welcomed addition to AudioKit.  If there is an open source code base for performing
this function we could probably adapt it for AudioKit.
