/// ## Validation rules:
/// - The clip itself must be valid as defined by the clip's isValid function.
/// - The clips in the array must not overlap each other (clip.time + clip.duration <= nextClip.time).
///
/// The strategy used when a new clip overlaps an existing clip is last-in precedence.  Existing
/// clips will shortened, split, or removed in order to make room for the new clip.  Since clips
/// can be split or removed, merging a clip may result in the clip count decreasing when a clip is
/// merged, or increasing by more than 1.  This behavior requires that the clip merger create clips,
/// so to facilitate this need it uses a delegate.  When a clip is to be shortened, it is removed
/// from the existing clips, and a new clip is created using the delegate's newClip function.  When
/// a clip is to be split, the original is removed and newClip will be called twice.  When a clip is
/// removed, the delegate's clipWillBeRemoved function will be called (if implemented).
