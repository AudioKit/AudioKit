    ///   - reverbDuration: The time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB from its original

    ///   - loopDuration: The loop time of the filter, in seconds. This can also be thought of as the delay time.
    ///                   Determines frequency response curve, loopDuration * sr/2 peaks spaced evenly
    ///                   between 0 and sr/2. (Default: 0.1, Minimum: 0.0, Maximum: 1.0)
