//: ## Plotting
//:
//: Playgrounds are a very visually compelling interface and you create a few
//: different ways  of seeing what is happening to your audio signal.
//:
//: * [Output Waveform Plot](Output%20Waveform%20Plot)
//: * [Rolling Output Plot](Rolling%20Output%20Plot)
//: * [Node Output Plot](Node%20Output%20Plot)
//: * [Node FFT Plot](Node%20FFT%20Plot)
//:
//: ## Audio Analysis
//:
//: * [FFT Analysis](FFT%20Analysis)
//: * [Tracking Amplitude](Tracking%20Amplitude)
//: * [Tracking Frequency](Tracking%20Frequency)
//: * [Tracking Frequency of Audio File](Tracking%20Frequency%20of%20Audio%20File)
//: * Tracking Microphone Input appears in the macOS Development playground since iOS playgrounds don't have access to the micorphone
