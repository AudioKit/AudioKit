//: ## Dry Wet Mixer
//: It's very common to mix exactly two inputs, one before
//: processing occurs, and one after, resulting in a combination
//: of the two.  This is so common that many of the AudioKit nodes have a
//: dry/wet mix parameter built in.  But, if you are building your own
//: custom effects, or making a long chain of effects, you can use
//: AKDryWetMixer to blend your signals.

let file = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav", baseDir: .resources)
var drums = try AKAudioPlayer(file: file)

//: Build an effects chain:

var delay = AKDelay(drums)
delay.time = 0.1
delay.feedback = 0.8
let reverb = AKReverb(delay)
reverb.loadFactoryPreset(.largeChamber)

//: Mix the result of those two processors back with the original

let mixture = AKDryWetMixer(drums, reverb, balance: 0.5)
