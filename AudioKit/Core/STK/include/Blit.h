/*! \class Blit
    \brief STK band-limited impulse train class.

    This class generates a band-limited impulse train using a
    closed-form algorithm reported by Stilson and Smith in "Alias-Free
    Digital Synthesis of Classic Analog Waveforms", 1996.  The user
    can specify both the fundamental frequency of the impulse train
    and the number of harmonics contained in the resulting signal.

    The signal is normalized so that the peak value is +/-1.0.

    If nHarmonics is 0, then the signal will contain all harmonics up
    to half the sample rate.  Note, however, that this setting may
    produce aliasing in the signal when the frequency is changing (no
    automatic modification of the number of harmonics is performed by
    the setFrequency() function).

    Original code by Robin Davies, 2005.
    Revisions by Gary Scavone for STK, 2005.

    This function sets the number of harmonics contained in the
    resulting signal.  It is equivalent to (2 * M) + 1 in the BLIT
    algorithm.  The default value of 0 sets the algorithm for maximum
    harmonic content (harmonics up to half the sample rate).  This
    parameter is not checked against the current sample rate and
    fundamental frequency.  Thus, aliasing can result if one or more
    harmonics for a given fundamental frequency exceeds fs / 2.  This
    behavior was chosen over the potentially more problematic solution
    of automatically modifying the M parameter, which can produce
    audible clicks in the signal.
