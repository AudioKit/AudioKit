/*! \class FileLoop
    \brief STK file looping / oscillator class.

    This class provides audio file looping functionality.  Any audio
    file that can be loaded by FileRead can be looped using this
    class.

    FileLoop supports multi-channel data.  It is important to
    distinguish the tick() method that computes a single frame (and
    returns only the specified sample of a multi-channel frame) from
    the overloaded one that takes an StkFrames object for
    multi-channel and/or multi-frame data.

    Data from a previously opened file will be overwritten by this

    is to be loaded incrementally from disk and normalization is
    specified, a scaling will be applied with respect to fixed-point
    limits.  If the data format is floating-point, no scaling is
    performed.
