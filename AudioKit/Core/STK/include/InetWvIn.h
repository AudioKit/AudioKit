/*! \class InetWvIn
    \brief STK internet streaming input class.

    This Wvin subclass reads streamed audio data over a network via a
    TCP or UDP socket connection.  The data is assumed in big-endian,
    or network, byte order.  Only a single socket connection is
    supported.

    InetWvIn supports multi-channel data.  It is important to
    distinguish the tick() method that computes a single frame (and
    returns only the specified sample of a multi-channel frame) from
    the overloaded one that takes an StkFrames object for
    multi-channel and/or multi-frame data.

    This class implements a socket server.  When using the TCP
    protocol, the server "listens" for a single remote connection
    within the InetWvIn::start() function.  For the UDP protocol, no
    attempt is made to verify packet delivery or order.  The default
    data type for the incoming stream is signed 16-bit integers,
    though any of the defined StkFormats are permissible.
