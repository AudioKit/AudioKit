/*! \class InetWvOut
    \brief STK internet streaming output class.

    This WvOut subclass can stream data over a network via a TCP or
    UDP socket connection.  The data is converted to big-endian byte
    order, if necessary, before being transmitted.

    InetWvOut supports multi-channel data.  It is important to
    distinguish the tick() method that outputs a single sample to all
    channels in a sample frame from the overloaded one that takes a
    reference to an StkFrames object for multi-channel and/or
    multi-frame data.

    This class connects to a socket server, the port and IP address of
    which must be specified as constructor arguments.  The default
    data type is signed 16-bit integers but any of the defined
    StkFormats are permissible.
