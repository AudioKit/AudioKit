/*! \class Messager
    \brief STK input control message parser.

    This class reads and parses control messages from a variety of
    sources, such as a scorefile, MIDI port, socket connection, or
    stdin.  MIDI messages are retrieved using the RtMidi class.  All
    other input sources (scorefile, socket, or stdin) are assumed to
    provide SKINI formatted messages.  This class can be compiled with
    generic, non-realtime support, in which case only scorefile
    reading is possible.

    The various \e realtime message acquisition mechanisms (from MIDI,
    socket, or stdin) take place asynchronously, filling the message
    queue.  A call to popMessage() will pop the next available control
    message from the queue and return it via the referenced Message
    structure.  When a \e non-realtime scorefile is set, it is not
    possible to start reading realtime input messages (from MIDI,
    socket, or stdin).  Likewise, it is not possible to read from a
    scorefile when a realtime input mechanism is running.

    When MIDI input is started, input is also automatically read from
    stdin.  This allows for program termination via the terminal
    window.  An __SK_Exit_ message is pushed onto the stack whenever
    an "exit" or "Exit" message is received from stdin or when all
    socket connections close and no stdin thread is running.

    This class is primarily for use in STK example programs but it is
    generic enough to work in many other contexts.
