/*! \class RtWvIn
    \brief STK realtime audio (blocking) input class.

    This class provides a simplified interface to RtAudio for realtime
    audio input.  It is a subclass of WvIn.  This class makes use of
    RtAudio's callback functionality by creating a large ring-buffer
    from which data is read.  This class should not be used when
    low-latency is desired.

    RtWvIn supports multi-channel data in both interleaved and
    non-interleaved formats.  It is important to distinguish the
    tick() method that computes a single frame (and returns only the
    specified sample of a multi-channel frame) from the overloaded one
    that takes an StkFrames object for multi-channel and/or
    multi-frame data.
