//: # AudioKit for OSX Playgrounds
//:
//: AudioKit comes with many playgrounds, each of which serves to teach some core concept, demonstrate a particular generator or synthesizer, or just show off some wacky sounds that we've discovered.  Because there are so many playgrounds that are inter-related in different ways, the order of the playgrounds in Xcode is more or less alphabetical, however this index page lists all the the playgrounds grouped by category.  Playgrounds that fit into multiple categories are listed in each relevant category.
//:
//: ## Getting Started
//:
//: Let's start off just making sure you're all set up and can make sound.
//:
//: * [Introduction and Hello World](Introduction%20and%20Hello%20World)
//:
//: ## This is going to be fun...
//:
//: So wait, before we jump into the actual tutorials, let's just highlight some of the cooler sound playgrounds we have.  Don't try to understand the code if you're just started, it will all be expained starting with the next section, Basic Tutorials.
//:
//: * [Electro Drum Beat](Drum%20Synthesizers)
//: * [Alien Apocalypse](Linear%20and%20Exponential%20Segment%20Operations)
//: * [Telephone](Telephone) - Dialtone, ringing, busy signal, and digits
//: * [EXS24 Sampler](Sampler%20Instrument%20-%20EXS24)
//: * [Crazy Drum Effects](Variable%20Delay)
//: * [Phase-Locked Vocoder](Phase-Locked%20Vocoder)
//:
//: ## Mac OS X Playgrounds
//:
//: These playgrounds are exclusive to OS X because they use some feature not availalable on iOS, for instance microphone input.
//:
//: * [Tracking Microphone Input](Tracking%20Microphone%20Input)
//: * [XY Pad](XY%20Pad)
//:
//: ## Basic Tutorials
//:
//: These tutorials help you get started with the basic concepts of AudioKit, starting with what you need to know about playgrounds in general and then moving on to sound creation and working with AudioKit nodes.
//:
//: * [Non-Audio Tutorial](Non-Audio%20Tutorial)
//: * [Connecting Nodes](Connecting%20Nodes)
//: * [Mixing Nodes](Mixing%20Nodes)
//: * [Splitting Nodes](Splitting%20Nodes)
//: * [Dry Wet Mixer](Dry%20Wet%20Mixer)
//: * [Balancing Nodes](Balancing%20Nodes)
//: * [Stereo Panning](Stereo%20Panning)
//:
//: ## Plotting
//:
//: Playgrounds are a very visually compelling interface and you create a few different ways  of seeing what is happening to your audio signal.
//:
//: * [Output Waveform Plot](Output%20Waveform%20Plot)
//: * [Rolling Output Plot](Rolling%20Output%20Plot)
//: * [Node Output Plot](Node%20Output%20Plot)
//: * [Node FFT Plot](Node%20FFT%20Plot)
//:
//: ## Audio Analysis
//:
//: * [Tracking Amplitude](Tracking%20Amplitude)
//: * [Tracking Frequency](Tracking%20Frequency)
//:
//: ## "Analog Synth X" Example Project
//:
//: AudioKit is shipped with an awesome synth example project and the following playgrounds are where we developed and tested out the effects for that synth.
//:
//: * [Fatten Effect](Fatten%20Effect)
//: * [Filter Section](Filter%20Section%20Example)
//: * [MultiDelay](MultiDelay%20Example)
//:
//: ## Designing Sound
//:
//: These playgrounds are inspired by the "Practicals" section of the book "Designing Sound", by Andy Farnell.  While this book is excellent, the examples are implemented in Pd, which is okay, I guess, but hey, this is AudioKit!
//:
//: * [Pedestrians](Pedestrians)
//: * [Telephone](Telephone) - Dialtone, ringing, busy signal, and digits
//:
//: Hopefully we'll add more practicals over time.  If you're interested in making more, submit a pull-request to git repo and we'll be sure to include them.
//:
//: ## Playback Nodes
//:
//: Over the course of viewing the playgrounds so far, you've come across AKAudioPlayer repeatedly.  It is a simple neough class that it doesn't require a playground of its own, but there are some playback-oriented nodes that are very useful and cool.
//:
//: * [Sampler Instrument - EXS24](Sampler%20Instrument%20-%20EXS24)

//: * [Pink Noise Generator](Pink%20Noise%20Generator)
//: * [White Noise Generator](White%20Noise%20Generator)

//:
//: ### Delay Nodes
//:
//: Delay is a lot more powerful than simply repeating an earlier sound.  By varying parameters, you can get startlingly beautiful effects.
//:
//: * [Delay](Delay)
//: * [Variable Delay](Variable%20Delay)
//:
//: ### Distortion
//:
//: Distortion is a category for nodes that do more than just filter a sound, and basically change something essential to the sound, usually making for a harsher sound, but that's a matter of taste.

//: * [Bit Crush Effect](Bit%20Crush%20Effect)
//: * [Decimator](Decimator)
//: * [Ring Modulation](Ring%20Modulation)

//:
//: Hey you got all the way to the bottom of this file, why not let us know by emailing audiokit@audiokit.io.  We'd love to hear from you!
