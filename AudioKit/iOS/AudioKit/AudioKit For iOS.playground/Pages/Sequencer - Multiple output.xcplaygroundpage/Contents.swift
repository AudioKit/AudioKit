//: ## Sequencer - Multiple output
//:
import XCPlayground
import AudioKit

//: Create the sequencer, but we can't init it until we do some basic setup
var sequencer: AKSequencer

//: Create some samplers, load different sounds, and connect it to a mixer and the output
var sampler1 = AKSampler()
var sampler2 = AKSampler()
sampler1.loadEXS24("Sounds/sawPiano1")
sampler2.loadEXS24("Sounds/sqrTone1")

//: NOTE: As of Xcode 7.3, the EXS24 sampler has stopped working properly in playgrounds. We have filed a bug report and we hope that Apple fixes it in the future.  With that hope, we haven't deleted this playground.  The EXS24 works just fine in a project setting, just not in playgrounds.  To see how it used to work visit: https://vimeo.com/152230901

var mixer = AKMixer()
mixer.connect(sampler1)
mixer.connect(sampler2)

let reverb = AKCostelloReverb(mixer)

AudioKit.output = reverb

//: Load in a midi file, and set the sequencer to the main audiokit engine
sequencer = AKSequencer(filename: "4tracks", engine: AudioKit.engine)

//: Do some basic setup to make the sequence loop correctly
sequencer.setLength(4)
sequencer.enableLooping()
//: Here we set each alternating track to a different instrument
//: (Note that track 0 in our case is just meta information...not actual notes)
sequencer.avTracks[1].destinationAudioUnit = sampler1.samplerUnit
sequencer.avTracks[2].destinationAudioUnit = sampler2.samplerUnit
sequencer.avTracks[3].destinationAudioUnit = sampler1.samplerUnit
sequencer.avTracks[4].destinationAudioUnit = sampler2.samplerUnit

//: Hear it go
AudioKit.start()
sequencer.play()
