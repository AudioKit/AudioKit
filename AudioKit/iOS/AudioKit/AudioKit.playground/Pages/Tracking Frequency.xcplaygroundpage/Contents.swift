//: ### Tracking frequency is just as easy as tracking amplitude, and even
//: ### includes amplitude, but it is more CPU intensive, so if you just need amplitude,
//: ### use the amplitude tracker.

let oscillatorNode = AKOperationGenerator() { _ in
    // Let's set up the volume to be changing in the shape of a sine wave
    let volume = AKOperation.sineWave(frequency: 0.2).scale(minimum: 0, maximum: 0.5)
    
    // And let's make the frequency also be a sineWave

    return AKOperation.sineWave(frequency: frequency, amplitude: volume)

let booster = AKBooster(tracker, gain: 1)
let secondaryOscillator = AKOscillator()

//: The frequency tracker passes its input to the output,
//: so we can insert into the signal chain at the bottom
AudioKit.output = AKMixer(booster, secondaryOscillator)
AudioKit.start()

oscillatorNode.start()
secondaryOscillator.start()

//: And here's where we monitor the results of tracking the amplitude.
