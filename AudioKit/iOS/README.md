# AudioKit iOS Projects

## AudioKit For iOS Xcode project

This project is used to build the AudioKit and AudioKitUI frameworks. It can also be used directly by dragging the .xcodeproj into your Xcode project and adding the two AudioKit frameworks as embedded binaries (under the "General" tab).

The AudioKit folder here contains code specific to iOS that would not work on the macOS platform.  Mostly these are UIKit based User Interface elements.
