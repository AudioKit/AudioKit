//: # macOS Development Playground
//: The set of playground pages in this playground either can only exist on macOS, or they are works in progress that haven't yet been made cross-platform. 
//:
//: * [XY Pad](XY%20Pad) - using an NSView to draw onto a canvas and play sounds
//: * [Callback Instrument](Callback%20Instrument) - connect UI to audio events.  While the call back instrument works on iOS, it does not work in iOS playgrounds.
//: * [Tracking Microphone Input](Tracking%20Microphone%20Input) - sing into your Mac and it will analyze you!
