# AudioKit For tvOS Xcode project

This project is used to build the AudioKit and AudioKitUI frameworks. It can also be used directly by dragging the .xcodeproj into your Xcode project and adding the two AudioKit frameworks as embedded binaries (under the "General" tab).

tvOS is very similar to iOS but with fewer features. For example, it does not include a microphone or MIDI.
