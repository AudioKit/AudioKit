description:
  This is was built using the JC reverb implentation found in FAUST.
  According to the source code, the specifications for this implementation were
  found on an old SAIL DART backup tape.

  This class is derived from the CLM JCRev function, which is based on the use of
  networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters.  This class implements three series
  allpass units, followed by four parallel comb filters, and two decorrelation delay lines in
  parallel at the output.
