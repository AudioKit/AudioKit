description:
  Moog Ladder is an new digital implementation of the Moog ladder filter based on the work of Antti Huovilainen, described in the paper "Non-Linear Digital Implementation of the Moog Ladder Filter" (Proceedings of DaFX04, Univ of Napoli).
  This implementation is probably a more accurate digital representation of the original analogue filter.
