# AudioKit Analog Synth X Example

This is a full-featured iPad synthesizer app example by **Matthew Fecher** and **Aure Prochazka** built with Swift and AudioKit! It includes examples of Audiobus, Inter-app audio, and more.

The complete source code is available now as MIT open source. Meaning, you can use it as a learning tool, or even create your own synth app from the code. There's no charge or fee to use the code. Use it as a starting point to create the synth of your dreams!

## Sound Tips for Analog Synth X:

* You can get a pure Sine wave by (1) turning the Osc Mix to the left (2) turning off VCO1 (3) Turning the FM up!
* Use the morph knob between square and pulse for basic PWM control.
* Not getting enough low-end for your liking? Turn down the Rez.
* Use 2 saws and detune VCO2 for a shimmery vintage Polysynth sound. Slowly open the filter to your taste.
* The reverse saw LFO (the last wave setting on the LFO) can simulate a basic voltage-controlled note repeat.
* Keep dry/wet knobs under 50% for a more powerful sound.
* Turn the ADSR Release down to zero and turn the echo on to hear how the echo taps fire.

## Get in the Code:

* The sub is set to a sine wave for a more powerful bass tone. You can change it to a square if you'd like the synth to have more of a vintage feel. You can also experiment between -12/-24 settings.
* Try changing the preset knob bounds (minimum/maximum) in the SynthViewController to extremes to play a synth with wild settings!
* Sub and FM are tracked to the keyboard. Try tracking them to VCO1 for a more accurate Analog synth effect. (i.e. If you detune VCO1, FM & Sub also detune).
