/** Tracks the pitch of a signal.
 
 Takes an input signal, splits it into hopSize blocks and using a STFT method,
 extracts an estimated pitch for its fundamental frequency as well as estimating the
 total amplitude of the signal in dB, relative to full-scale (0dB). The method
 implies an analysis window size of 2*hopSize samples (overlaping by 1/2 window),
 which has to be a power-of-two, between 128 and 8192 (hopsizes between 64 and 4096).
 Smaller windows will give better time precision, but worse frequency accuracy
 (esp. in low fundamentals).
 
 Based on an original algorithm by M. Puckette.
