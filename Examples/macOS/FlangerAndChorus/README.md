# AudioKit FlangerAndChorus Example

This is a lightly-reworked version of the HelloWorld example, illustrating the use of the new Flanger and Chorus effects.

It also illustrates some useful things like using MIDI, and loading presets (e.g. .aupreset files) into the AKMIDISampler.
Most of the interesting stuff is in Conductor.swift, but you will also find some important setup in ViewController.swift.
