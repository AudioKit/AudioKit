//: ## Bit Crush Effect
//: An audio signal consists of two components, amplitude and frequency.
//: When an analog audio signal is converted to a digial representation, these
//: two components are stored by a bit-depth value, and a sample-rate value.
//: The sample-rate represents the number of samples of audio per second, and the
//: bit-depth represents the number of bits used capture that audio. The bit-depth
//: specifies the dynamic range (the difference between the smallest and loudest
//: audio signal). By changing the bit-depth of an audio file, you can create
//: rather interesting digital distortion effects.
