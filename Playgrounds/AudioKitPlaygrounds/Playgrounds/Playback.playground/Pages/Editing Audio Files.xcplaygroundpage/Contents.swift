//: ## Editing Audio Files
//: Let's have some fun with our drum loop
import AudioKitPlaygrounds
import AudioKit

//: First load the drumloop

let loop = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav")

//: You may have noticed that the drumloop doesn't loop so well. Let's fix this...
let fixedLoop = try loop.extracted(fromSample: 0, toSample: Int64(3.42 * 44_100))

//: Now out drumloop is one bar long and perfectly loops. Let's extract the kick,
//: the snare and hihat into sixteenth note long files:
let oneBarLength = fixedLoop.samplesCount

let oneSixteenthLength = oneBarLength / 16

let kick = try  fixedLoop.extracted(fromSample: 0, toSample: oneSixteenthLength)
let snare = try fixedLoop.extracted(fromSample: oneSixteenthLength * 4,
                                    toSample: oneSixteenthLength * 5)
let hihat = try fixedLoop.extracted(fromSample: oneSixteenthLength * 2,
                                    toSample: oneSixteenthLength * 3)

//: Notice that we don't provide any name or location for those files (in fact, we don't care...)
//: If no name / location are set, files will be created in temp directory with a unique name.
//: But you could choose name and location if you wish. Let's check this:

let kickFileName = kick.fileNamePlusExtension
let kickFilePath = kick.directoryPath

//: I love hihat, so normalize our Hihat sample so it will be as loud as other instruments...
let normalizedHihat = try hihat.normalized()

//: Why not making some new files by reversing them
let reverseKick = try kick.reversed()
let reverseSnare = try snare.reversed()
let reverseHihat = try normalizedHihat.reversed()

// A sixteenth note silence could be handy...
let silence = try AKAudioFile.silent(samples: oneSixteenthLength)

//: Now, we put all them in an array so we can later randomly pick samples.
//: Some are doubled so they'll have more luck to be picked.

let samplesBox: [AKAudioFile] = [kick, snare, kick, snare, kick, snare,
                                 normalizedHihat, reverseKick, reverseSnare, reverseHihat,
                                 silence, silence, silence, silence, silence]

//: Now, we'll play the original loop three times,
let threeTimesLoop = try fixedLoop.appendedBy(file: fixedLoop)
var sequence = try threeTimesLoop.appendedBy(file: fixedLoop)
//: Next, we append a random sequence of 16 sixteenth of audio to build our random drum solo...

for i in 0..<16 {
    let newSampleIndex = (0..<samplesBox.count).randomElement()!
    let newSound = samplesBox[newSampleIndex]
    AKLog("picked sample #\(newSampleIndex) name: \(newSound.fileNamePlusExtension)")
    var newFile = try sequence.appendedBy(file: newSound)
    sequence = newFile
}

//: Each time you'll run this playground, the resulting audioFile will be different.
//: Let's listen to our edited audiofile: Original Loop 3 times,
//: followed by the "drum solo of the day"...
