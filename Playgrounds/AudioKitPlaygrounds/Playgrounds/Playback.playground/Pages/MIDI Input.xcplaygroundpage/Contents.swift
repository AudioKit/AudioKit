//: ## MIDI Input
//: This playground is kind of a basic MIDI Monitor. Make sure you've got the console view open,
//: and then start pounding on the MIDI devices you have hooked up to your computer and you should see output.

let midi = AudioKit.midi

//: The input names list all of the MIDI devices currently hooked up
midi.inputNames
//: By opening up MIDI Input without specifying a particular port, we open up all ports.
midi.openInput()

//: By defining a class that is a MIDI Listener, but with no functions overridden,
//: we just get the default behavior which is to print to the console.

let receiver = PlaygroundMIDIReceiver()

//: Add the new class to the list of MIDI listeners
