//: # Synthesis Playgrounds
//:
//: AudioKit comes with many playgrounds, each of which serves to teach some
//: core concept, demonstrate a particular generator or synthesizer, or just
//: show off some wacky sounds that we've discovered.  Because there are so
//: many playgrounds that are inter-related in different ways, the order of the
//: playgrounds in Xcode is more or less alphabetical, however this index page
//: lists all the the playgrounds grouped by category.  Playgrounds that fit
//: into multiple categories are listed in each relevant category.
//:
//:
//: ## Designing Sound
//:
//: These playgrounds are inspired by the "Practicals" section of the book
//: "Designing Sound", by Andy Farnell.  While this book is excellent, the
//: examples are implemented in Pd, which is okay, I guess, but hey, this is AudioKit!
//:
//: * [Pedestrians](Pedestrians)
//:
//: Hopefully we'll add more practicals over time.  If you're interested in
//: making more, submit a pull-request to the git repository and we'll be sure to include them.
//:
//: Oscillators are the basis of many synths which also usually have envelopes:
//:
//: * [Filter Envelope](Filter%20Envelope)
//:
//: ### Physical Models
//:
//: * [Dripping Sounds](Dripping%20Sounds)
//: * [Drum Synthesizers](Drum%20Synthesizers)
//: * [Flute](Flute)
//: * [Mandolin](Mandolin)
//:
//: ## Operations
//:
//: Many of the types of things you can do in nodes are also possible with operations,
//: but with great flexibility in how the parameters are changed over time.
//:
//: * [Segment Operations](Segment%20Operations)
//: * [Phasor](Phasor%20Operation)
//:
//: ### Sporth
//:
//: Sporth is a simple but super-powerful stack-based audio processing language
//: that you can run directly in AudioKit. This playground contains several examples of sound synthesis with Sporth.
//:
//: * [Sporth Based Generator](Sporth%20Based%20Generator)
