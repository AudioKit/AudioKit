AudioKit is an audio synthesis, processing, and analysis platform for iOS, macOS (including Catalyst), and tvOS.

## Installation

Using Xcode, you can add AudioKit and any of the other AudioKit libraries using Collections

1. Select File -> Add Packages...
2. Click the `+` icon on the bottom left of the Collections sidebar on the left.
3. Choose `Add Swift Package Collection` from the pop-up menu.
4. In the `Add Package Collection` dialog box, enter `https://swiftpackageindex.com/AudioKit/collection.json` as the URL and click the "Load" button.
5. It will warn you that the collection is not signed, but it is fine, click "Add Unsigned Collection".
6. Now you can add any of the AudioKit Swift Packages you need and read about what they do, right from within Xcode.

## Documentation

Docs appear on the [AudioKit.io Web Site](https://audiokit.io/). You can also generate the documentation in Xcode by pulling down the Product menu and choosing "Build Documentation".
