# AudioKit iOS Development Project

This project is a handy project for developers of AudioKit because it set up with:

* The AudioKit framework included as a subproject so you can make edits to it directly
* Development playgrounds for quick proofs of concept
* A simple project with a vanilla AudioKit signal chain that you can edit as necessary
* A sandbox test file to put new unit tests in
* The full suite of AudioKit tests so that you can quickly check that you haven't broken something unexpected
