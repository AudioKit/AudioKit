AudioKit Documentation
======================

AudioKit is documented in a few different, but related ways.

## Github Wiki 

AudioKit's inline comments are processed by [SwiftDoc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc) and automatically create documentation on [AudioKit's Github Wiki](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/wiki).

## Migration Guide

The [Migration Guide](MigrationGuide.md) contains a lot of good information on converting your app from Version 4 to 5.

## README files

We try to include a README folder in every directory of AudioKit to describe folders' contents and to provide some basic quickstart information.

README files can contain *TO DO* sections which contain things that could or should improve the material in that folder.

## Sampler Overviews

* [Survey of AudioKit's Sampler Options](../Sources/AudioKit/Nodes/Playback/Samplers/Samplers.md)
* [Sampler in-depth](../Sources/AudioKit/Nodes/Playback/Samplers/Sampler/Sampler.md)
